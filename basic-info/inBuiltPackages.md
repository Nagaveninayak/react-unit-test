## 1. React testing libraries

react testing libraries are already present when the `create react-app` is run

In the packages we have
`"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
"@testing-library/react": "^13.0.0",
"@testing-library/user-event": "^13.2.1" `

In the react
"react-scripts": "5.0.1"
is based upon the jest
