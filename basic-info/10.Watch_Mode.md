### Jest Watch Mode

Watch mode is an option that we can pass to Jest asking to watch files that have changed since the last commit and execute tests related only to those changed files

An optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have

For example, when there are no active commit or changes, yarn test will display `No tests found related to files changed since last commit.`

Which basically means there are no changes and need to run all the tests present in the folder

If there are any changes to a particular file, and you save it. It will rerun the saved file which inturn reduces the execution speed

React has inbulit watch mode for the jest file
