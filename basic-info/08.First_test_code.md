## First sample code to check if a element text is present or not

code in the component file - greet.tsx - <h1>Hello</h1>

code in the text file - greet.text.tsx

```js
test("greet component renders correctly", () => {
  render(<Greet />);
  const testElement = screen.getByText("hello");
  expect(testElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

The above will give you error since Hello !== hello

you can also use regex `/hello/i` to check without case sensitive
