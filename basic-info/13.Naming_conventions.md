### Naming convention

The following are the popularly used naming conventions for test file, in order just to find out

1. Files with .test.js or .test.tsx suffix

2. Files with .spec.js or .spec.tsx suffix

3. Files with .js or .tsx suffixin `__tests___` folders ( example: `__tests___` --> greet-test.js)

Recommendation is to always put your tests next to the code they are testing so that relative imports are shorter.
