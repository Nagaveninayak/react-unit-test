### Every test we write generally involves the following basic steps

1. Render the component
   To render the component, we use the render method from RTL

2. Find an element rendered by the component

3. Assert against the element found in step 2 which will pass or fail the test
   For assertion, we use expect passing in a value and combine it with a matcher function from jest or jest-dom

### RTL QUERIES

Queries are the methods that Testing Library provides to find elements on the page

1. To find a single element on the page, we have
   getBy..
   queryBy..
   findBy..

2. To find multiple elements on the page, we have
   getAllBy..
   queryAllBy..
   findAllBy..

3. The suffix (..) can be one of:
   Role
   LabelText
   laceHolderText
   Text
   DisplayValue
   AltText
   Title
   Testld

### getBy... queries

getBy.. class of queries return the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found
