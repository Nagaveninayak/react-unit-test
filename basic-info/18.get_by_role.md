### getBy... queries

getBy.. class of queries return the matching node for a query, and throw a descriptive error if no elements match or if more than one match is found

The suffix can be one of Role, LabelText, PlaceHolderText, Text, DisplayValue, AltText, Title and finally Testld

### getByRole

By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role

Button element has a button role, anchor element has a link role, h1 to h6 elements have a heading role, checkboxes have a checkbox role, radio buttons have a radio role and so on

If you're working with elements that do not have a default role or if you want to specify a different role, the role attribute can be used to add the desired role

To use an anchor element as a button in the navbar, you can add role='button'
