### Code Coverage

A metric that can help you understand how much of your software code is tested

1. Statement coverage: how many of the statements in the software code have been executed

2. Branches coverage: how many of the branches of the control structures (if statements for instance) have been executed

3. Function coverage: how many of the functions defined have been called

4. Line coverage: how many of lines of source code have been tested

### Below gives complete report of all the coverage along with the files

1. To cover all the files
   `"coverage": "yarn test --coverage --watchAll"`

2. To cover only components files (whose type is ts not js)
   `"collectCoverage": "yarn test --coverage --watchAll --collectCoverageFrom='src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}'"`

3. To cover only test components files (aka ignore types, helpers, constants etc)
   `"yarn test --coverage --watchAll --collectCoverageFrom='src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}' --collectCoverageFrom='!src/components/**/*.{types,stories,constants}.{ts,tsx}"`
